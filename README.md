# Rock_Paper_Scissors

## Aims
The aim of this project was to implement a rock, paper, scissors playing bot that would use subconscious cyclic patterns in a human's play to win more games than if it were to just play randomly.
We then looked to see how the AI performed against a truly random opponent.

## Usage

In order to play against the AI you can either:

### Play in MATLAB Console

To play against AI through console, run play_game.m and use the keyboard to input your moves.

### Play in App

To play against the AI or a random opponent through the GUI, run app.mlapp and use the mouse to select your move.

### Play Against Random Opponent

To simulate the AI playing against a truly random opponent, run play_game_auto.m.

## To Do

I can change the many .m files full of if statements for each of the agents to a single function that uses modulo arithmetic to decide what move the bot makes.
This will be a much more elegant solution.
